# Project diary
This is the first time I'm developing a project individually.
I'm going to try to go through all the steps, from designing the business to implementing the UI.
This diary will track the process so that I can improve.

# 2024-02-04
- Have an idea to build a simple project with all components: OpenAPI spec, Quarkus Rest service, UI.
Take the chance to apply new things into this project.
In the end, this should be a simple application that allows users to register a new bank account.
- Init the quarkus project
- Draw the happy case diagram

# 2024-02-05
- Define the data models and service interfaces. Try applying onion architecture.
- Implement an in-memory repository for quick access.
- Implement some simple services.

# 2024-02-21
- Consider Rest API; how can I define APIs to serve the UI?
- Draw the happy case and API interaction diagrams.

# 2024-02-21
- Add some simple endpoint to api-spec
- Configure gradle plugin `org.openapi.generator` to build the API spec
